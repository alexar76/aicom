## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-06

Public trust & reproducibility release for the factory line.

### Added
- **Honest factory CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): backend pytest + coverage badge
  generated in Actions, strict frontend `typecheck` / `lint` / `build` (no
  `continue-on-error`), security benchmark, customer API smoke.
- **Security scan workflow** (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`): Bandit High
  blocks; pip-audit + npm audit reports uploaded as artifacts.
- **`scripts/quickstart.sh`** — clone → one command → Docker + demo enqueue.
- **`docs/sample-output/`** — static build replay JSON (see without running Docker).
- **`scripts/export_sample_build_replay.py`** — regenerate sample replay from code.

### Changed
- Coverage badge (`docs/badges/coverage.svg`) refreshed by CI on `main`, not
  hand-edited locally.
- `python-multipart` bumped to ≥ 0.0.18 (KI-5 partial).
- KI-3: `USE_SQLITE=true` forces `UVICORN_WORKERS=1`; crash telemetry appended to
  `uvicorn-last-crash.log`.

### Removed
- CI lint `continue-on-error` escape hatch (ROADMAP “Now”).
